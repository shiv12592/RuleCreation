When the SimulationPopUp opens, it immediately calls the simulateCounts API at /v1/simulate using a POST request, sending the condition object (e.g., { ecn: 'someEcnValue', simulate: true }) to fetch summary count data (like affected users, entitlements, etc.).
When the user clicks the "View Details" button, the simulateResults API is triggered at /v1/simulateResults via a GET request. This call passes additional filter criteria (such as entitlementName, userName, pageNo, and pageSize) along with the original condition to retrieve detailed simulation results.
Clicking the "Export" button invokes the simulateResultsExport API at /v1/simulateResultsExport through a GET request, sending the condition data plus an export flag so that the server returns a CSV file for download.
The condition data is built and continuously updated in the CreateRule page by the RuleConditionRows component, ensuring that the most recent rules configuration is sent to the backend.
Each API call occurs at specific user interaction stages: opening the popup triggers the summary count call, viewing details retrieves the detailed list, and exporting initiates the CSV download.
