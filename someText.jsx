Here's the updated template based on the provided details and image:

Starting the Conversation:
Greet Warmly & Connect Personally:
"Hi Param, it's so nice to catch up with you after so long! How are you and the kids doing? I hope they're doing great—how's life in Phoenix?"
(If she asks about you or your family):
"Oh, Ashvika is keeping us on our toes—she's two now and incredibly naughty! It's such a fun and tiring phase, but we're really enjoying it."

I also really admire how you manage to balance your family and work so gracefully. It’s something I look up to, and it motivates me to find that balance in my own life as well. It’s always great to work with someone who sets such an example."

  
Transition to Work:
Discuss Current Work:

"Param, Kapil has been the main driving force behind the business logic and workflows in the Rule Service. While I focus more on the UI aspects, we sometimes don’t have full visibility into all the changes and features he’s planning to add in the future. If there’s something specific you need clarity on, I can always follow up with him to get the details."

"Regarding the current work on the Rule Service, things are going well on the UI part that I'm handling. I know you're aware that Alex is managing the API side, but I just wanted to mention that I also have experience with APIs and would love to work on them more in the future if the opportunity arises. For now, though, I'm coordinating closely with Alex to ensure everything aligns with his perspective on the backend."
Acknowledge Challenges (if needed):

"As a contractor, I've been putting my best into this role, but I have faced a few challenges, like balancing responsibilities or sometimes managing the scope of tasks without having full-time access to certain resources. However, I’ve been learning and trying to contribute as much as possible."
Closing the Call:
Bring Up Your Request for Permanent Payroll:
"Param, before we wrap up, I wanted to check with you—have you had a chance to consider my earlier request about moving to the permanent payroll with Amex? I know we discussed it briefly last time, and I truly enjoy working here and contributing to the team. I'd love to explore if that's still a possibility."
Additional Tips:
Stay positive and focus on how much you enjoy the work and the team.
Mention how being on the payroll could help you contribute even more effectively (e.g., stability, access to resources).
End with gratitude: "Thank you so much for taking the time to discuss this with me, and for always being supportive. It really means a lot."


Talking About Rule Engine UI Updates:
"Param, I also wanted to share some updates regarding the Rule Engine UI. We've seen more changes and new features being added recently, and from what I can tell, it's only going to expand further in the future. It's exciting to see how it's evolving, and I feel there's a lot of potential for us to enhance its functionality even more."

"I’m staying closely aligned with the updates and changes on the UI side, and I’m always looking for ways to improve and streamline it. I’d love to continue contributing to these updates and make the UI as user-friendly and efficient as possible."
