Looking at your IAM Rule Microservice architecture and flow diagrams, I can see this is a comprehensive rule-based access management system at AE-s. Let me break down the step-by-step process in detail:

**Summary**
The IAM Rule Service manages two primary flows: Allow/Deny Rules for access request validation and Auto Provision/Revoke Rules for automated user lifecycle management based on HR attribute changes.

**Brief Explanation**

## Allow/Deny Rules Flow

**Step 1: Request Initiation**
- User logs into IIQ (SailPoint IdentityIQ) through AuthBlue SSO
- Requester selects entitlement(s), user, and submits access request in IIQ
- IIQ navigates to the request access screen with all necessary details

**Step 2: Rule Search and Validation**
- IIQ triggers the Rule Service REST API to search for applicable rules
- Rule Service iterates over requested entitlements using RuleController → RuleDelegate → DbUtil
- For each entitlement, it finds matching rules based on rule conditions stored in PostgreSQL Rule DB
- System checks if request has more entitlements to process (Yes/No decision point)

**Step 3: Condition Evaluation**
- Rule Executer processes each found rule's conditions against the request context
- Conditions are evaluated using attribute mappings (Department Code, Business Unit Code, Job Code, etc.)
- If conditions pass: Request proceeds normally
- If conditions fail: System collates all violation results

**Step 4: Response Handling**
- Rule Service returns results (violation messages) to IIQ
- If violations exist: IIQ displays return messages for each entitlement violation to requester
- If no violations: Request moves forward in normal approval workflow
- Process ends after displaying appropriate messages

## Auto Provision/Revoke Rules Flow

**Step 1: HR Data Change Detection**
- Scheduler detects changes in LCM Datastore user profile table (HR attributes)
- Changes can include: Department transfers, role changes, terminations, new hires
- Attribute Change Triggers log change records in user_gnt_dto_chg table

**Step 2: Rule Processing**
- Scheduler fetches threshold information for each attribute-value pair
- Rule Consumer calls Rule Service via Threshold API
- Rule Service executes rule conditions for the given attribute-value pair against current user profile

**Step 3: Threshold Evaluation**
- System checks if access changes exceed defined thresholds
- If threshold breached: Proceeds to rule execution
- If within threshold: Sends notification to Rules Owners and stores users in Executer table

**Step 4: Rule Execution and Action**
- Rule Executer processes threshold-exceeding changes
- Based on rule type (Auto Provision/Auto Revoke), system:
  - **Auto Provision**: Adds new entitlements/access based on new HR attributes
  - **Auto Revoke**: Removes inappropriate access based on changed attributes

**Step 5: Kafka Integration**
- Rule results are published to Kafka topic "Auto Provision"
- Provisioning Engine IIQ consumes from this Kafka topic
- IIQ processes the provision/revoke requests automatically
- Audit trail is maintained in Rule DB for compliance

## Technical Integration Points

- **Authentication**: AuthBlue SSO handles user authentication across all components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL Rule DB stores rules, audit logs, user executer data
- **Communication**: REST APIs for synchronous calls, Kafka for asynchronous processing
- **Monitoring**: Splunk captures all transaction logs and system metrics
- **Frontend**: ReactJS with Redux manages rule creation, listing, and two-level navigation (Attestation/Threshold Execution)

This architecture ensures automated compliance management while providing manual oversight capabilities for sensitive access decisions.
